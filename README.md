# Crystal Collector

A simple game that uses jquery/javascript to dynamically display web content. 4 crystals are displayed and given random values from an array of four numbers, and then the user is given an "amount" to collect. The user must add up the crystals by clicking on them to reach the designated total. If they go over, a loss is added to their loss counter and the game resets. If reach the total exactly, a win is added to their win counter and the game resets.
Created as an assignment for the University of Arizona Web Development Boot Camp.
